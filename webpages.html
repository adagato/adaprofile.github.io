<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>
As an employee on Missouri S&T's IT Relations team, I was frequently asked to perform website maintenance tasks. This involved updating content, correcting errors like broken links or formatting issues, and creating new webpages to spread important IT-related information to the campus community. In doing so, I became proficient with multiple content management systems, including WordPress and TerminalFour. During my graduate education, I had a course regarding HTML and CSS, and have since been able to create my own webpages from scratch using those languages. In fact, this portfolio website was made in such a fashion, with the files uploaded to a <a href="https://github.com/adagato/adaprofile.github.io">GitHub repository</a> to host the site. Below, you'll find examples of webpages and sites that I have created for both professional and academic settings.

	<h2><li>Security Keys</h2>
		<p>In the summer of 2022, the S&T IT department began distributing security keys to faculty. I was tasked with creating content that would provide information about the setup and usage of these keys. To do this, I created a webpage entirely about security keys. It includes links to a YouTube video that I made describing the setup process on Windows, a hyperlink to text-based setup instructions for Windows, MacOS, and Linux, as well as a link to a <a href="https://it.mst.edu/services/account-password/trustkey/securitykey-userguide/">second page</a> I created for commonly-asked questions about the keys.</p>

	<h2><li>HTML/CSS Class Project</h2>
		<p>In the fall of 2023, I was enrolled in a class that taught the basics of HTML and CSS. The final project in the class was to create our own website from scratch. As I have experience setting up servers to host multiplayer video games, I decided to focus my website on the server setup process for a Minecraft: Java Edition server. I also included information about helpful server commands that a host can use to modify the game to their liking. I was very interested in the project, and I decided to go beyond the assignment to learn the process of getting the site hosted and attached to a domain. As such, I purchased a domain and used GitHub to host the site. In doing so, I learned the procedure that I would later use to host this portfolio.</p>

	<h2><li>Inventory Review Project</h2>
		<P>This year, Missouri S&T's IT department commenced an inventory review project, where all campus IT equipment will be recorded. I collaborated with the leaders of the team to create a webpage regarding the project's status that could be updated biweekly as progress reports came out. It was intended to give a very brief overview of the project as well as provide some information about its completion and the team members involved. The finalized design linked below shows how I used TerminalFour to construct a dashboard, introduction, and list of those involved in the project. </p>
