<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>
As an employee on Missouri S&T's IT Relations team, I was frequently tasked with website maintenance, including updating outdated content, correcting errors like broken links or formatting issues, or creating new webpages as needed to spread information about changes to certain systems or to give information about new IT services. In doing so, I learned how to use multiple content management systems, including WordPress and TerminalFour. During my graduate education, I had a course regarding HTML and CSS, and have since been able to create my own webpages from scratch using those languages. In fact, this portfolio website was made in such a fashion, with the files uploaded to a <a href="">Github repository</a> to host the site. Below, you'll find examples of webpages and sites that I have created for both professional and academic settings.

	<h2><li>Inventory Review Project</h2>
		<P>Recently, Missouri S&T's IT department began an inventory review project, where all campus IT equipment will be recorded. As one of my last assignments at the IT department before I graduated, I was tasked with creating a webpage regarding the project's status, that could be updated biweekly as progress reports came out. It was to give a brief overview of the project as well as provide some statistics about the project's completion and the team members involved. The finalized design linked below shows how I used TerminalFour to construct a dashboard, introduction, and list of those involved in the project. </p>

	<h2><li>Security Keys</h2>
		<p>In the summer of 2022, the S&T IT department began distributing security keys to faculty. I was tasked with creating content that would provide information about the setup and usage of these keys. To do this, I created a webpage entirely about security keys. It includes links to a YouTube video that I made describing the setup process on Windows, a hyperlink to text-based setup instructions for Windows, MacOS, and Linux, as well as a link to a <a href="https://it.mst.edu/services/account-password/trustkey/securitykey-userguide/">second page</a> I created for commonly-asked questions about the keys.</p>

	<h2><li>HTML/CSS Class Project</h2>
		<p>In the fall of 2023, I was enrolled in a class that taught the basics of HTML and CSS. The final project in the class was to create our own website from scratch. As I have learned how to set up servers to host multiplayer video games, I decided to focus my website on the server setup process for a Minecraft: Java Edition server. I also included information about helpful server commands that a host can use to modify the game to their liking. I was very interested in the project, and I decided to go beyond the assignment to learn the process of getting the site hosted and attached to a domain. As such, I purchased a domain and used Github to host the site. In doing so, I learned the procedure that I would later use to host this portfolio.</p>
