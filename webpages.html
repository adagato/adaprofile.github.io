<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>
As an employee on Missouri S&T's IT Relations team, I was frequently asked to perform website maintenance tasks. This involved updating content, correcting errors like broken links or formatting issues, and creating new webpages to spread important IT-related information to the campus community. In doing so, I became proficient with multiple content management systems, including WordPress and TerminalFour. During my graduate education, I had a course regarding HTML and CSS, and have since been able to create my own webpages from scratch using those languages. Below, you'll find examples of webpages and sites that I have created for both professional and academic settings.

	<h2><li>Security Keys</h2>
		<p>In the summer of 2022, the S&T IT department began distributing security keys to faculty. I was tasked with creating material regarding the setup and usage of these keys. The following webpage includes text-based setup instructions for Windows, MacOS, and Linux, a link to a YouTube video that I made describing the setup process on Windows, as well as a link to a second page that answers commonly asked questions about the keys.

	<h2><li>HTML/CSS Class Project</h2>
		<p>In the fall of 2023, I was enrolled in a class that taught the basics of HTML and CSS. The courseâ€™s final project was to create our own website from scratch. As I have experience setting up servers to host multiplayer video games, I built a user guide for setting up a Minecraft: Java Edition server on Windows. I was very interested in this project, and I decided to continue my work even after the final was submitted to learn the process of getting the site publicly available. To do this, I used a GitHub repository to host the site and purchased a domain for it. Since then, I have been able to apply the lessons I learned during this project to other personal and class-related websites such as this portfolio site.</p>
