<p class="PageHeader"><b>Changing the Game: Server Commands</b></p>

<body>

	<h2>What are Server Commands?</h2>
		<p>Server commands let you adjust the server or change gameplay elements while you are in-game. They can be performed by typing "/" followed by the command and its new setting. Check the table below for a list of commonly-used commands.</p>

<table class="table1">
	<thead>
		<tr>
			<th><b>Command</b></th>
			<th><b>Function</b></th>
		</tr>
	</thead>
		
	<tr>
		<td><b>/gamemode</b></td>
		<td>Change to play in creative, survival, spectator, or adventure. Press space after typing the command and enter your preferred gamemode.</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td><b>/op &lt;u&gt;</b></td>
		<td>Where &lt;u&gt; is a player's username, grants that user host privileges.</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td><b>/time set</b></td>
		<td>Changes the time of day on the server. Add a space after the command and type "day" for sunrise, "noon" for noon, "dusk" for sunset, and "night" for night. You can also type a number for more specific times, ranging from 1000-24000.</td>	
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td><b>/weather</b></td>
		<td>Changes the weather on the server. Add a space and type "clear" to stop rain, "rain" to start rain, or "storm" to start a storm.</td>		
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td><b>/gamerule mobGriefing</b></td>
		<td>Add a space and type "true" to allow mobs like creepers to destroy blocks. Type "false" to disable this ability.</td>	
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td><b>/tp &lt;u1&gt; &lt;u2&gt;</b></td>
		<td>Where &lt;u1&gt; &lt;u2&gt; stand in for two usernames, teleports &lt;u1&gt; to &lt;u2&gt;'s location</td>	
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td><b>/difficulty</b></td>
		<td>Allows the player to set the difficulty level of the world. The options are peaceful, easy, normal, or hard.</td>	
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td><b>/whitelist on</b></td>
		<td>Enables a whitelist on the server, meaning that only people on the list can connect and play. This helps protect the server from malicious actors scanning the net for Minecraft servers to destroy players' builds on, but can make it more difficult for your friends to connect.</td>	
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td><b>/whitelist add &lt;u&gt;</b></td>
		<td>Where &lt;u&gt; is a player's username, adds that user to the whitelist, letting them connect to the server if the whitelist is enabled.</td>	
	</tr>
