<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>During my collegiate career, two of the projects that I worked on were published. Those two works as well as some information about them can be found below.

	<h2><li>Panoply 2022</h2>
	
<p>
In the fall of 2021, I was enrolled in a layout & design class that taught me how to use Adobe InDesign to create graphics and other documents. The final project for the class was a competition to design the department newsletter for Missouri S&T's English and Technical Communication department. We were instructed to follow the branding guidelines that Missouri S&T requires, and were provided with most of the textual content that the newsletter includes. My design was selected to be the 2022 newsletter, and it was distributed across the campus community via the <a href="https://english.mst.edu/department/newsletters/panoply-2022/">department's website</a> as well as in print.

	<h2><li>Southwinds 2022</h2>
	
<p>
During my spring 2022 semester at Missouri S&T, I joined the campus literary arts club Southwinds, which publishes a printed magazine of photographs, art, and written works from members of the campus community. While the club had lost a lot of members in the previous semesters from the pandemic and graduations, I worked with two other club members to collect, select, and organize submissions into a magazine, ensuring that we documented all the steps of the process so that future club members could use what we learned as a guide. The issue was published just before the end of the spring semester, and I would continue working with Southwinds to encourage more of my peers to join. The two club members who helped make the issue and I gave a presentation about our efforts to revitalize the club at the <a href="https://csca-net.org/aws/CSCA/asset_manager/get_file/764999?ver=0#page=8">2023 Central States Communication Association conference</a> in St. Louis. Nowadays, Southwinds has been able to acquire more members and funding and has a greater ability to showcase the creative talent of the Missouri S&T campus community. A .pdf version of the printed magazine is shown below.
