<h2>Bio</h2>

<p>
Hi there! I'm Adam Rentz, and I'm a recent graduate with an M.S. in Technical Communication from Missouri University of Science and Technology. During my time there, I was able to be exposed to a variety of communications related challenges through the positions that I held while earning my degrees that have helped me understand how to effectively communicate to specific audiences. I have been exposed to many methods of communication, such as professional research proposals, departmental newsletters, and infographics.
