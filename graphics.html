<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>
I have frequently created graphics for both personal and professional settings. In doing so, I have become proficient in Adobe InDesign as well as photo editing platforms like Photoshop. I learned popular graphic design theories like Gestalt theory, which suggests that graphics should be seen as a single scene instead of as a collection of individual parts. To accomplish this, you'll find that the elements on the graphics presented here are there for a reason, even if that reason is to blend into the background of a larger scene.

	<h2><li>Artemis Launch</h2>
		<P>As a part of my position on Missouri S&T's IT Relations team, I frequently worked with groups outside the IT department to create communications material for them. One of the campus's means of communication is the MinerBytes system, which is a series of televisions and monitors across campus that display information in the form of graphics or short animations. I was contacted to create such a graphic for a viewing of NASA's Artemis I launch in the fall of 2022. As the MinerBytes screens can be oriented both vertically or horizontally, I needed to create a design that could suit both orientations. As such, the vertical and horizontal representations of the design are shown here.</p></li>

	<h2><li>Southwinds Submissions Flyer</h2>
		<P>In my role on the Southwinds literary arts magazine club, I was tasked with spreading the word that the club was gathering submissions for our next issue. Part of this campaign was a flyer that was distributed across buildings on campus, which called for submissions and provided a QR code link to the (now closed) form that would allow students to submit their work from their mobile devices.</p></li>
