<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>
I have been tasked with the creation of graphics many times as a part of both my education and work experience. In doing so, I have become proficient in Adobe InDesign as well as the GIMP photo editing platform. Additionally, I have developed an understanding for the efficiency and effectiveness of using graphics in communication. Many of my graphics incorporate Gestalt theory, where viewers are intended to view the document as a whole instead of as a collection of the individual parts. To accomplish this, you'll find that every element on the graphics presented here is there for a reason, even if that reason is to blend into the background of a larger scene.

	<h2><li>Artemis Launch</h2>
		<P>As a part of my job on Missouri S&T's IT Relations team, I frequently worked with groups outside the IT department to create communications material for them. One of the campus's means of communication is the MinerBytes system, which is a series of televisions and monitors across campus that display information in the form of graphics or short animations. I was contacted to create such a graphic for a group on campus that wanted to host a watch event for NASA's Artemis I launch in the fall of 2022. As the MinerBytes screens can be oriented both vertically or horizontally, I needed to create a design for both orientations. Both representations of the design are shown here.</p></li>

<b>Common Questions</b>
</p>

<ol>
	<h2><li>How frequently does Computers and Composition Online publish?</h2>
		<P>Rather than publishing in scheduled editions, <i>Computers and Composition Online</i> publishes as soon as a submission has been fully accepted. This comes as a result of the journal being entirely online, with no print publications.</p></li>

	<h2><li>How strict is the submission process?</h2>
		<P>The journal states that it has rather lenient submission guidelines, with language that reads "If you have work available, we encourage you to submit." That said, all submissions must be intended for the web, not print. More information about formatting conventions can be found below.</p></li>	
	
	<h2><li>What is the peer review process? How long does it take?</h2>
		<p>Submissions are screened by staff for content relevancy and formatting before being sent to the review board for an external peer review. The process takes roughly 4 weeks during the academic year. In some cases, submissions may be sent to a C&W specialist to ensure that it is reviewed by current subject experts.</p></li>
		
	<h2><li>Is the journal focused on academics or industry?</h2>
		<p>This journal focuses heavily on academics, especially the interactions between academics and technology.</p></li>
		
	<h2><li>What organization owns or manages this journal?</h2>
		<p><i>Computers and Composition Online</i> is the online-only "companion journal" to <i>Computers and Composition: An International Journal.</i> It is not connected to any conferences. The journal does have <a href="http://cconlinejournal.org/resources.htm">awards</a>, however, with five awards being handed out in different categories. Nominations for this year's awards are due on March 15th.  </p></li>	
	
	<h2><li>How relevant was this journal to Online Social Movements?</h2>
		<p>While being a journal focused primarily on academia, it still contains a wide range of articles that can fit the subject matter of the Online Social Movements class. Particularly relevant are discussions of how technology and technological movements are changing the nature of classrooms and the social structures found there. In particular, there is a variety of papers discussing technofeminism, many of which can be connected with the material found in our class. All of the papers I found were linked from the journal's <a href="http://cconlinejournal.org/index.htm">homepage</a>.</p></li>	
	
	<h2><li>What format does this journal require?</h2>
		<p><i>Computers and Composition Online</i>, with its heavy focus on the usage of technology in the classroom, asks that submissions make use of the tools available to them in an online format. The journal only accepts online submissions in order to further encourage this type of submission style. Common features of journal submissions include a small website-like layout, with a page heading, navlinks, and other multimedia functions. Submissions can include videos, audio recordings, images, and other software pieces. That said, all video and audio files must be captioned or come with transcripts, alt text should be included, and iamges must be original works or used with permission. For examples of submissions that make use of these web-specific features, see the <a href="http://cconlinejournal.org/index.htm">list of submissions</a> featured on the journal's homepage.
